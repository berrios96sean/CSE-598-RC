SDC file 'ex4p.sdc' not found
Setting default timing constraints:
   * constrain all primay inputs and primary outputs on a virtual external clock 'virtual_io_clock'
   * optimize virtual clock to run as fast as possible
Timing constraints created 1 clocks
  Constrained Clock 'virtual_io_clock' (Virtual Clock)
