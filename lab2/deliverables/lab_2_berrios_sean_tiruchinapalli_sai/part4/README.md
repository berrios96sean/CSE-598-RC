For baseline design, copy `mm_driver.py` `matrix_mult.py` and `mm_p4.ipynb` to a folder 
with the dev board. From there you should be able to just run the Jupiter notebook to verify the 
functionality. 
Harware files are located in the part4 directory. 

For the optimized design, you do not need the driver python files, as there were some issues that 
came up I copied the needed functions into the Jupiter notebook `mm_opt_p4EC.ipynb` you should be able 
to just run this notebook and recreate the results. 
Hardware files for optimized solution are located in the optimized folder of the part4 directory. 
e.g. `../part4/optimized`
